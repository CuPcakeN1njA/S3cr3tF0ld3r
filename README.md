Hidden folder that is hidden and unhidden using a password.

## Set up
Firstly clone this rep.

Now you can copy the key.sh file and the hidden folder for the type of OS you have, and place them where you want keeping the hidden folder in the same directory as key.sh.

Now change the value in the password file to the password you want.

### Windows Only
Once this is done you just have to run the batch file. If you want you
could even use an online tool to create an .exe.

### Linux Only
Once this is done you will want to run ```chmod +x key.sh```

Now when you run the command ```./key.sh``` it will prompt you for the password.
enter the password and you should see that the directory is hidden.
